# Refreshing My Knowledge of the OSI Model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network protocols in seven layers. Each layer serves a specific function and communicates with the layers directly above and below it.

### The Seven Layers of the OSI Model:
Physical Layer: Deals with the physical connection between devices and the transmission of binary data over physical mediums like cables.
Data Link Layer: Ensures error-free data transfer between two directly connected nodes and handles MAC addresses.
Network Layer: Manages data routing, forwarding, and addressing (e.g., IP addresses).
Transport Layer: Provides reliable data transfer services to the upper layers, including error recovery and flow control (e.g., TCP, UDP).
Session Layer: Manages sessions or connections between applications.
Presentation Layer: Translates data between the application layer and the network, handling data encryption, compression, and translation.
Application Layer: Provides network services directly to end-user applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
Understanding the OSI model helps in troubleshooting network issues and designing efficient network systems
