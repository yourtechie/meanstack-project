# About Load Balancing
Load balancing is the process of distributing network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, thus improving performance and reliability.

### Types of Load Balancing Algorithms:
1. Round Robin: Distributes requests sequentially across a group of servers.
2. Least Connections: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
3. Weighted Round Robin: Assigns more traffic to servers with higher capacities.
4. IP Hash: Uses the IP address of the client to determine which server receives the request.
5. Resource-Based: Considers the current load on each server, such as CPU and memory usage, before distributing traffic.

Load balancing can be implemented using hardware devices or software solutions, and it is crucial for maintaining high availability and performance in web applications.
